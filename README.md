# tictactoe

Just a basic Ruby command line Tic Tac Toe game. You can only play against the computer. Unbeatable AI version
and also a beatable version that "forgets" rules.

A single-file app. To run, simply navigate to where it's installed, then type `ruby ttt.rb` on the command line.

This version has been superceded by [Tic-Tac-Toe v.2](https://github.com/globewalldesk/tictactoe2).
